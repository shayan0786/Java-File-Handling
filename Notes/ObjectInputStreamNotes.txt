ObjectInputStream

ObjectInputStream is a Java class used to read Java objects from a file or input stream.
It is mainly used in deserialization.

One-liner:
ObjectInputStream = Object reader from file ✔️

File → FileInputStream → ObjectInputStream → Object

Deserialization is the process of converting a byte stream back into a Java object.

Load = Deserialization

File → ObjectInputStream → Object

Buffer Reader
Buffer Reader is the java class that read the input stream from the file using the buffer 
This read line by line instead of character by character

It use buffer pool store the READED DATA IN RAM IT ALSO USE ANOTHER READER fILErEADER TO READ AND THEN IT by using it gives the 


File → FileReader → BufferedReader → Program

| Feature | FileReader | BufferedReader |
| ------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Speed   | Slow       | Fast 🚀        |
| Reads   | Char       | Line           |
| Buffer  | No         | Yes ✔️         |
| Use     | Small file | Large file     |


Summary (Cheat Sheet)

Reads line by line ✔️

Faster than FileReader ✔️

Uses buffer ✔️

Best for big files ✔️

Code
__________

package Code.src;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferReaderDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String line;  beacuse it store line by line 
        try{
            BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("../data/bufferreaddemo.txt"));
             Buffer reader use file reader to read it file then store it in buffer pool and gives the read data 
             it is fatsyt that is why we use
            while ((line = bf.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        }catch(IOException e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
